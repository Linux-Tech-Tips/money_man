# Money App

Money Man, the application, is a very simple bash script made to manage CSV tables, with the specific interest of tracking (monthly) expenses.

The first version is programmed entirely in Bash, and works on the basis of files. The script makes it simpler to manage CSV spending records saved in multiple files.
